# What is the MNIST Dataset?
The MNIST dataset is a collection of **28x28 grayscale images** of **handwritten digits (0–9)**, totaling **70,000 images**:
--> **60,000 training images**: Used to train the model.
--> **10,000 test images**: Used to evaluate the model’s performance.

# Each image is:

**28x28 pixels**, making it a **784-dimensional input (28x28=784)**.
Labeled with the digit it represents (e.g., 0, 1, 2... up to 9).

# What is MNIST Digit Classification?
It’s a classification task where the goal is to build a model that takes an image of a handwritten digit as input and correctly predicts the digit (0–9) as the output.
